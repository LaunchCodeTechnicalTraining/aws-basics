## Creating Your First S3 Bucket

In order to create an S3 Bucket you will need to provide the following:
- `Bucket Name`: This name must be unique. If there is an existing bucket with the desired name you will not be able to create the bucket.
- `Object Ownership`:
- `Public Access`: Public access is blocked by default. This behavior can be changed.
- `Bucket Versioning`:
- `Encryption`:

### Bucket Name
For your first bucket you will only need to provide a unique name and leave all other options as they have been defaulted.

The name I used  while creating the bucket is "my-first-bucket-john".

### Public Access

Leave the public access and versioning  options as the default.

### Tags

You do not need to add a tag for this walkthrough, and the `Default Encryption` should be disabled.

After you have completed the above steps hit the `Create Bucket` button.
